Course Project for Johns Hopkins Data Science - Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================================================================
##### Objective of the project
* To demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
* To prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

##### Deliverables
* A tidy data set with average of each variable for each activity and each subject described in the **Cleaning Raw Data** section.
* A link to this Github repository.
* A Code Book, included in this Github repository
* A Readme, included in this Github repository

##### Data Source
see http for detailâ€¦



##### Cleaning Raw Data

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data.
4. Appropriately labels the columns with descriptive names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
